Description: A repository of the functions and datasets I use. Many of the 
    Applied Econ function code was inspired from Professor Roger Keener 
    at Illinois (found here http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~econ508/e-ta.html) 
    while the methodologies are attributable to my classes with Professor 
    Robert Kaufmann at Boston University.
